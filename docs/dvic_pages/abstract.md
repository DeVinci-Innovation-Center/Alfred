# Alternative 1

Industry 4.0 has become the standard for factory automation. Network-controlled, intelligent machines allow for faster production, at lower cost and risk. Robots have become controllable remotely, and as such, the worker in this new type of industry, a "Worker 2.0", needs to adapt to these new methods of production.

ALFRED is an Artificial Intelligence-based middleware for robotic arms. The system uses a modular architecture, with a high degree of abstraction inspired by modern Operating Systems. ALFRED can be deployed on robotic arms with minimal adjustments. It is built for pushing Human-Robot interaction forward, with multiple modalities of interaction and high performance, in business or research applications.

# Alternative 2

ALFRED brings safety, adaptability and connectivity to any commercial robotic arm. ALFRED is a middleware, enhanced by Artificial Intelligence, focused on modularity, extensibility and abstraction. Inspired by modern Operating Systems, it brings together devices, interfaces and the robotic arm to create a system ready to be deployed in real situations. ALFRED is a way for manufacturers and researchers to develop applications for a robotic arm with minimal knowledge about robotic control. It integrates in its environment with its multiple interaction modalities, such as manual control with hands, voice control, and a web interface.

# Alternative 3

Basic automation requires a robot to only repeat a set of movements indefinitely, but with the needs of Industry 4.0, robotic systems need to be more and more complex. Safety, adaptability and connectivity are now required for automation in the industry. Safety comes in the form of smart collision detection, with sensitive robots that know their environments and react to unseen obstacles or operators. Adaptability requires robots to have intelligent decision making systems and powerful sensing abilities. Robots need to communicate with each other to share information, and to be able to be controlled remotely for easier access.
